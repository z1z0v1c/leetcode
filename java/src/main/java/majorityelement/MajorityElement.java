package majorityelement;

/**
 * Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
 * <p>
 * The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
 * You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: nums = [3,2,3]
 *      Output: 3
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
 *      Output: 2
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 *      - n == nums.length
 *      - 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
 *      - -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
 * <p>
 * Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
