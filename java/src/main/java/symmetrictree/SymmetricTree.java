/**
 * 101 - Easy
 * <p>
 * Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
 *      Output: true
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
 *      Output: false
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 *      - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
 *      - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
